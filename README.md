# SampleKituraAdminPanel-swift
This is a sample web server showing what can be done with IBM's Kitura swift web servers. This utilizes a sample Bootstrap Admin panel found at https://colorlib.com/wp/free-bootstrap-admin-dashboard-templates/

Feel free to clone this and try new things with it. Make sure that the run script build phase is working properly when building so that your website will be loaded when the web server requests it.
